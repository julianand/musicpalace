# This is NOT the Next.js you know

This version has breaking changes — APIs, conventions, and file structure may all differ from your training data. Read the relevant guide in `node_modules/next/dist/docs/` (resolved from this file's directory; in monorepos the `next` package may not be visible from the repo root) before writing any code. Heed deprecation notices.

This block is written and re-added by `next dev` — verify at `node_modules/next/dist/server/lib/generate-agent-files.js`. Removing it from a diff only re-creates the uncommitted change; committing it with your work keeps the tree clean.

## Tech stack

- Next.js 16 (App Router)
- React 19
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS v4
- Prisma ORM (PostgreSQL)
- Supabase (Auth + Database)

## Project conventions

### Navigation
- **Always use `<Link href="...">` from `next/link` for internal app navigation.** Never use a plain `<a href="...">` for internal routes — it triggers a full page reload and bypasses Next.js client-side routing.
- Plain `<a>` is only acceptable for external URLs (e.g. `href="https://..."`) or when intentionally forcing a hard navigation.

### File naming
- Use **kebab-case** for all component files (e.g. `related-scroll.tsx`, `product-card.tsx`). Never use PascalCase filenames.

## Database

### Prisma client
- The generated client lives at `app/generated/prisma/client` — import from there, not from `@prisma/client`.
- The client requires the `PrismaPg` driver adapter (see `lib/prisma.ts`). Never instantiate `PrismaClient` without it.

### Seed / backup
- `prisma/seed.ts` contains a full snapshot of the production data (users, product_categories, products, reviews).
- It is idempotent: uses `upsert` on every record, so it can be re-run safely without duplicating data.
- After inserting, it resets PostgreSQL sequences so future `autoincrement()` IDs don't collide.
- Configured in `package.json` under `"prisma": { "seed": "tsx prisma/seed.ts" }`.

> **Known, expected build error:** `next build` / `tsc` fails in `prisma/seed.ts` with `TS2737: BigInt literals are not available when targeting lower than ES2020` (the `tsconfig.json` `target` is `ES2017`). This is **normal** — do not fix it and do not flag it as a regression. Skip `prisma/seed.ts` when validating type checks/builds unless explicitly asked to address it.

**To recreate the database from scratch:**
```bash
npx prisma db push   # creates tables from schema.prisma
npx prisma db seed   # inserts all records from the backup
```

**To run the seed against the local .env:**
```bash
npx tsx --env-file=.env prisma/seed.ts
```
